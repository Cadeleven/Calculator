# Calculator
 I have made a simple CALCULATOR using Android Studios.  It can perform different mathematical operations like Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction also calculating Exponents(eg: 5^2, 7^3)  This calculator has Front end & back end  Front-End: Made in activity_main.xml Back-End: Made in MainActivity.java  I made different buttons in it (eg: 1, 2, 3, รท)  Finally after compleating the writing part, I run it and it run successfully.
